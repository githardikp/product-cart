# Product Cart
One day project on making a product cart system, where data is fetched from backend, displayed to user and functionality to add it to cart is there. Will remake it completely using zustand once done without any state management library

- User will be able to add product to cart
- User will be able to remove the product from cart
- frontend will fetch the latest data from backend every few seconds
